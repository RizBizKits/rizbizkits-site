**On #AdaLovelaceDay19:**

***   

“How can I be concise, and accurate? How can I best pass along my intention, my information, to my readers?” <a target="_blank" href="http://meghan-barrett.com/blog/2016/09/07/the-poetical-science-of-ada-lovelace/">(credits)</a>


Isn’t that the sole intention with which we pick up a pen to write? To measure into ounces, these thoughts our brains formulate into more lasting sentences? The above highlighted quote I stumbled upon in an article in which the author puts forth a case about how THE Ada Lovelace used both her insights into seeing poetry and science to, eventually, connect dots to a grander picture.  

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">“If you can't give me poetry, can't you give me poetical science?”</h3>  
-Ada


Now, I’m no one to begin to understand Ada’s understanding of this world.
Her vision is one which, few, and certainly not I, could ever emulate or comment on. But her mention of poetical science found me transfixed as if an actual lightbulb in my brain had switched on.  

“It is not a trivial trait for either a poet or a scientist to get to the heart of the matter simply, succinctly and successfully. These may be just the skills we need today”. It’s hard not to agree with Toole – poets and scientists are forever circling similar writing obstacles: how can I be concise, and accurate? How can I best pass along my intention, my information, to my readers? <a target="_blank" href="http://meghan-barrett.com/blog/2016/09/07/the-poetical-science-of-ada-lovelace/">(credits)</a>

Reading this, I could not _not_ smile. My eyes lit up. I’ve yet to meet a poet in the Tech industry. Perhaps, Ada was onto something more than _just_ the Analytical Engine...

Until next time.
