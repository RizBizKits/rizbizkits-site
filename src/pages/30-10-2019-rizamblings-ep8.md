A deep dive into Project Function with special guest and fellow Co-Founder, Daryl Cecile. We ramble on orange juice, my issues with saying the word "water", and loads more on our Project Function journey (including a very exciting #PFAnnouncement!)  

Finally, for the first time, we have an ominous 3rd voice who goes by the name of Mary.
