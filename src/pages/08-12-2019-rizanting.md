**(Nottingham-famous, Tom Jepson, has laid out a challenge to create content, daily, for the month of December. This is day _eight_. #Dec19ContentChallenge )**    
<hr/>   


And would you look at that! The clock has passed by midnight yet again, and Iâ€™m only just beginning to write this now. Sundays are entirely perfect for both that last minute panic-driven productivity and some uninterrupted procrastinating. I was meant to have done so much in this weekend, especially as another pesky deadline waits for its time to lunge at me by Tuesday. _(Best I did achieve over the past two days was to literally clean the kitchen sink into its original, spotless state.)_  


Recently, Iâ€™ve been existing on a week by week basis. Balancing the long list of responsibilities, added by myself as well as the universe, is an extreme sport of juggling. Youâ€™d think the first time I almost missed a deadline would teach me a lesson, right? Alas, I find myself recklessly continuing in this path of not getting shit done before time. And trust me, this isnâ€™t a personal flaw thatâ€™s been newly detected; I leave stuff last minute, I welcome the tension and stress of overworking the night before a deadline, and then narrowly make it. Rinse and repeat. This has been my default for as long as I can rememberâ€¦and thatâ€™s not an exaggeration.   


Of course, I donâ€™t at all understand me _(and my 2 brain cells)_, that chose this unhealthy routine and then framed in in such a way that my brain refuses to believe I could ever thrive without it. Because, yes, I have been more creative in this state than when I had ample time and an empty schedule. From poems to design in general, not having the time to pursue either in a day is the exact reason I was more conscious of the subtleties within any given day, to take my inspiration from this!  


Thus, to imagine a life where Iâ€™m not my most creative self? I, wholeheartedly, _canâ€™t._ Which brings me to an uneasy realisation: **Iâ€™ve forever claimed to detest hustle culture and anyone who preaches it, and yet I happen to be a _culprit?!_**  


_I have no ending worked out for this rant so Iâ€™ll end it, abruptly._  


ðŸ‘‹ _Catch you, another time._

Until next time.
