This is meant to be a short, simple blog post with a short, simple announcement. My usual writing is laden with clumsy magic tricks to let Clarity slip through the trap door in the ground (poets are after all, part-time magicians 🧐), so I’ll be upfront in this one as not to take a lot of your time. Here goes:  


<div class="full-width black-bg">
<h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">🚨 I’ve expanded my job search.</h2>
<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Holla @ the job market, <i>hire me!</i></h2> 

Have a gander at my CV:

**<h2>🔍 What I'm looking for:</h2>**  

I am looking for a **friendly** and **encouraging** environment that fosters personal-development and is open to new technologies. A place that provides opportunities to strengthen and give back to the community.  

My ideal workplace is one that values **diversity** and believes in providing spaces where _people whom may be seen as outsiders are given centre stage_.  

Due to being on a **Tier 4** student visa status, I am looking for a company that is able to **sponsor my work visa**. I would prefer to stay local to Nottingham but am open to moving to a different city.

I will be happy to work in a full **front-end** role or a healthy mix of **digital design** *and* **front-end**. I have experience in the following languages and technologies (plus, am more than willing to pick up new skills needed to strive in a suitable role!):

**<h2>🤔 Why Me?</h2>**

I graduate from Uni with a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree by June and will be available for a July start. I currently work part-time as a designer since July of last year, alongside full-time university. I am also a <a href="https://github.com/RizBizKits?tab=repositories" target="_blank">developer</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tinkererofwords/" target="_blank">poet</a>, a <a href="http://projectfunction.io/" target="_blank">co-founder</a>, and incredibly in awe and appreciative of life, for all opportunities it has given me.  


As a third-culture adult and international student who moved to Nottingham 3 years ago from Saudi Arabia, knowing almost no one in this foreign country, I have since then become a regular, familiar face in the local Tech meetups; taking up space at the front of the room onlooking audiences on multiple occasions. I stand out in crowds both because of being diverse and different, and because I leave a lasting impression on (most) people.  

<img src="/blog/riz-naconf.jpeg" alt="On stage the New Adventures 2019 conference" style="border-radius:2px;margin: 40px 0 40px; display: block; max-width: 100%;" />  


I’m pretty well-rounded in terms of skillset, checking those _people skills_ checkboxes just as much as _practical skills_, having picked those up through experience. I understand the differing complexities of development and design, having worked in teams doing both.  


I also rarely sit idle. When I wanted to improve my drawing, I committed to (and successfully achieved) drawing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/StoryofProgression/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1411679719146647" target="_blank">every single day</a> for 365 days. When I wanted to preserve the wisdom shared in meetups and conferences, I started to <a href="https://twitter.com/techcurating" target="_blank">curate</a> this into illustrated pieces. When I wanted to improve my public speaking and learn from the many, talented people that I had come to befriend through the community, I started to ramble with them on my <a href="http://nott.tech/rizpod" target="_blank">podcast</a>. When I realized I could help more people who were under-represented in the Tech industry like me, I started ProjectFunction (with an amazing <a href="http://darylcecile.net/" target="_blank">friend</a>), an <a href="http://projectfunction.io/" target="_blank">initiative</a> to _educate and encourage more minorities into Tech_ through free courses on Web Development / Design (successfully having taught 3 cohorts).

_I really do rarely sit idle._

From time to time, some kind people have said kind, reaffirming things about me:
