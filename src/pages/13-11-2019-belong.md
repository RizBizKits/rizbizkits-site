I’ll get just about six hours of sleep if I manage to finish writing this quicker than I usually do. See, sometimes the words show up at the worst times possible. As I’m sat on my work desk tomorrow, I’ll both lament my missed hours of sleep and profusely thank my writer-self for hopefully having written _something_. Regardless, only for the sake of some reduction in the dark circles under my eyes, I’ll get straight to the point.  

The past Monday at Tech Nottingham, I was facing an audience reading one of the first poems I wrote in 2016 as a fresh-faced International first year student in Nottingham, having traveled from then-home, Saudi Arabia. I promise you, I didn’t mean to do a lightning talk…but I have some friends whose encouragement seems to always get to me. Sure enough, next minute you know, I’m up reading a poem from the notes app of my broken-screen phone.  

The poem is rather a simple and honest one.  

I last read it in front of about 9 people, 3 years ago.  

Even today, my hands seem to quiver once I reach the last sentence.  

I like to call it, _Belong_.

<hr>  

i come from a country i didn’t grow up in  
so if you ask me to name streets or  
some pre-historic shops  
that sold antiques or sweets  
i will nod and tell you this:  

i know the alley where  
my grandfather built  
his home  
a not-at-all-posh place  
once surrounded by grass  
up till here  
but now, bustling with  
3 story unplanned buildings  
built by the sons and daughters  
of my grandfather’s friends,  
so their offspring could  
inherit a nest the size of a palace  
lacking the superficial  
status, the grandeur   
gates replaced  
by metal ones with  
un-oiled hinges  
so they creak so loud now  
it’s considered street music  

and i know  
the vegetable man  
and his kart  
and his struggle  
reduced  
even today to   
just  
a vegetable man  
he who screams  
the 9 different  
types of exquisite  
produce  
in 9 different well-practiced  
ways  
that jolt you awake  
into an hypnotic  
need to buy  
dusty potatoes,  

and  
don’t even  
get me started  
on the kulfi  
man, kulfi being  
a cone shaped  
frozen dairy dessert  
kind of like an ice cream  
if ice cream was justin biebs  
and kulfi was Beyoncé.  
so many days  
I’ve chased the tune  
that played from the kulfi  
man’s kulfi  
making machine,   
and i know this sounds crazy  
but i can hear it  
with these ears  
like some epic  
movie soundtrack  
for a backdrop  
of someone  
who’s found  
home in a  
place they didn’t  
even grow up in.   

Yet, I’m grateful  
to my parents  
and their decision  
to leave a place  
they did grow up in   
just so they  
could provide  
better for me  

and honestly,  
this day’s quite special  
because  
standing here  
even further away  
from that alley  

is proof they succeeded.  
In fact, coming to the UK,  
feels like i’m in space  
and though physically  
there’s more distance  

the farther you go  
the more home tugs  
at you  

and trust me,  

home is a stubborn feeling.   

it doesn’t need you to name shops or streets  

it just knows you belong.

Until next time.
