**(Nottingham-famous, Tom Jepson, has laid out a challenge to create content, daily, for the month of December. This is day _one_. #Dec19ContentChallenge )**    
<hr/>  

I’ve began and failed, already. It’s 5 minutes past 1AM on Sunday night _(or is it Monday morning?)_, which means it’s Dec 2nd, if we’re being super technical. To send out into the world one piece of content that you’ve created sounds pretty doable, no? I mean, there’s worse challenges faced by people all around the world than one such as this one, where the repercussions for failing are non-existent.  


18 minutes later, and sleep has kind of made blinking a chore, now. Truthfully, I blame the thought process that led itself into the HQ of my brain; _“why don't I spend 20 minutes making a custom GIF for this post?”_, I thought naively.  


_What else is one to do at midnight?_  


See, committing to a regular hustle is a sprint I have some familiarity running _(do you run a sprint or sprint a sprint? My brain is a curious, simpleton)_, shall we say.  


When I decided to draw every day, for an year, back in March of 2015, I hadn’t even considered how long a year can seem. To put aside enough time to pick up a blank canvas and to fill it, regardless of how rapidly the weather inside the confines of your brain happens to fluctuate, is best understood in retrospect. Fast-forward to a day in 2016 a whole year later, and I had done it…kind of.

A complete retelling of this experience would mean I keep writing till morning. Thus, I hope you accept my hasty transition into telling you about the time I got given an empty notebook and made up my mind to write, by hand, every day.  


Said notebook has never been written on for more than 1/4th its total pages.  


_What is it about words on paper?_  


You and I seem to have met at not such a great time. The weight of all the alarms awaiting to ring in the morning is heavy on the feathered nature of good writing.  


We have a month to get through. **I’ll catch you later.**

Until next time.
