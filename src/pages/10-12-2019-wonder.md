**(Nottingham-famous, Tom Jepson, has laid out a challenge to create content, daily, for the month of December. This is day _ten_. #Dec19ContentChallenge )**    
<hr/>   


10 days into writing daily and I think, today, I have hit the mark of worrying that I no longer have anything interesting left to say to you. Life’s been alright; I managed to submit a piece of coursework an amazing 5 hours before the midnight mark! This became cause for some newfound peace of mind AND nicely contrasted my headache-heavy morning.  


And before I lose all of your dwindling attention, take the wordsmith Dermot Kennedy’s riveting sentence as the missing crux for this muddled nothingness: _**my sense of wonder's just a little tired.**_

Until next time.
