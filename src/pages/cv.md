This is meant to be a short, simple blog post with a short, simple announcement. My usual writing is laden with clumsy magic tricks to let Clarity slip through the trap door in the ground (poets are after all, part-time magicians), so I‚Äôll be upfront in this one as not to take a lot of your time. Here goes:  



<div class="dark-bg">

<h2 style="margin-top:0;">Holla @ the job market, <i>hire me!</i></h2> 

Have a gander at my CV:

**<h2>ü§î Why Me?</h2>**

I graduate from Uni with a BSc (Hons) Computer Science degree by June and will be available for a July start. I already work part-time as a designer since July of last year alongside full-time university. I am also a developer, poet, a co-founder, and incredibly in awe and appreciative of life, for all opportunities it has given me.  


As a third-culture adult and international student who moved to Nottingham 3 years ago from Saudi Arabia, knowing almost no one in this foreign country, I have since then become a regular, familiar face in the local Tech meetups; taking up space at the front of the room onlooking audiences on multiple occasions. I stand out in crowds both because of being diverse and different, and because I leave a lasting impression on (most) people.  

I‚Äôm pretty well-rounded in terms of skillset, checking those people skills checkboxes just as much as practical skills, having picked these up through experience. I understand the differing complexities of development and design, having worked in teams doing both.  


I also rarely sit idle. When I wanted to improve my drawing, I committed to (and successfully achieved) drawing every single day for 365 days. When I wanted to preserve the wisdom shared in meetups and conferences, I started to curate this into illustrated pieces. When I wanted to improve my public speaking and learn from the many, talented people I had come to befriend through the community, I started to ramble with them on my podcast. When I realized I could help more people who were also a minority in the Tech industry like me, I started the initiative (with an amazing friend) to do just that.  

_I really do rarely sit idle._
