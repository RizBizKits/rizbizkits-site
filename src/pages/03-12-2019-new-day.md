_I feel as if I’m merely floating through some days,_

Moving, in some direction, without my feet choosing their steps? Take for instance, this bus ride. The only static figure, in this moment — my brain has conjured up — to be me, whilst the scenery zooms past the windows.  


I remember as a kid, reading a book at school that had aliens. It depicted our norms from the point of view of someone visiting planet Earth for the first time from outer space; cars moving were compared to little beetles, people became no more than spots, buildings probably were a set of boxes, and so on. I don’t recall much of the story. All that I have either imagined, or correctly remembered, is recognizing the sense of awe of our foreign visitors.  


For how simple the source of abundant wonder: zoom out enough until the we are all texture?! **All afloat, in some order.**  


_...you ever feel as if you’re merely floating through some days, too?_

Until next time.
