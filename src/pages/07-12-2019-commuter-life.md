_As a preface, I’m not hugely Gryffindorian (i.e. courageous, brave, daring etc.)._


However, out of the blue, I was reminded today of a random moment in my year-long commuter life, traveling to Lincoln for my internship. Commuting, itself, was a gruelling, tiresome routine but this is a rather fond memory. I guess it was sometime in March or April, as I was caught in that prolonged hesitation, weighing whether it was worth waking a fellow commuter on the train when the Lincoln stop arrived.   


When you share the early morning train, you get used to seeing the stream of familiar faces off to work or school or other responsibilities, on an almost regular basis, and so I knew this Commuter was going to miss her stop to Lincoln. Yet, no one seemed to notice which is why you’ll know where I’m going with this.  


I gently tapped her shoulder, pointing to the view outside. She seemed surprised and then immediately glad, profusely thanking me as we stepped onto the platform. My little act of almost-avoided bravery had yielded such immense gratitude from a stranger; I was enthralled by how a little kindness can greatly lift a heart. **This is what a poem looks like in real life.**

  
Much to my surprise, the next day, I was handed a _thank you_ card, a memento of a less tiring day in my brief life as a commuter.
