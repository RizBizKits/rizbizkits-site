This is me typing into Visual Studio Code during lunch break in a Subway, around the corner:  

*I'm unsure why the muse bothered me on this occasion? I have nothing in particular to say
to you, Reader. Perhaps, it was, then, the prospect of settling in?*

*You see, I have this dome of Web Sorcery, decorated almost as nicely as my brain had pictured, all to myself. It's a new feeling; hosting your own words in a more honest voice than any other Medium.*  

*It's already led me to this sandwich franchise, made me want to say something to YOU.* 

*Does one experience the same in a newly decorated room? Is a new coat of paint just as captivating? Or am I in the midst of something virtually unprecedented?*  

*Only now it wasn't even past noon. My lunch, too, is shortened.*
